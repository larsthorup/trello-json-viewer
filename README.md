## Development History

The project was developed using Cursor exclusively through the following prompts:

1. "create a html page to preview export files from trello. the page should have a text area where the trello export json file can be pasted. after the user inputs valid json it should be converted into markdown and shown in another text area. finally a div should contain the markdown rendered as html"

2. "the json contains checklists inside cards which should be converted to markdown lists"

3. "create a node program to extract the schema from a json file"

4. "run "node script.js export.json > schema.json""

5. "the checklists do not render correctly. use schema.json to understand how the input data is represented"

6. "create a table-of-contents showing the lists"

7. "make the input field have focus"

8. "create a readme.md and list all the prompts from this chat"

9. "add a badge to indicate that the code in this repo was generated by AI"
